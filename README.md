# # OBS CLR Browser Pokemon Let's Play assistant

I created this as something for myself to use in an upcoming Let's Play series, but seeing it's usefulness I wish to offer it to the community.

Currently it only supports 5th generation pokemon games and below, the reason behind this was a lack of consistant 6th generation sprites for the pokemon and badges. If I am able to locate more consistent sprites or someone can point me in the right direction I will happily update its functionality.

Imagery for the pokemon party slots as well as the badge slots are interchangeable, I created the ones there currently to go with my theme. If you wish to create your own and replace them all that is needed is to retain the dimensions of the images and simply replace them with the existing ones.

# Installing
1. Download the assistant
2. Place the folder in a desired location
3. Open up OBS and add a CLR Browser source
4. Under the CLR Browser settings click the question mark box [?]. 
5. locate the display.html file located in the lets play assistant folder, then set the "FPS" box to "1"
6. Arrange the source in the OBS window as desired.
7. Return to the let's play assistant folder and open up the index.html file to begin.
8. When ready to begin select your first pokemon, usually your starter, and click the Save Team button. (I reccomend keeping this window / tab open to easily update the team or badges when needed)
9. This will download a team.json file, you will need to move this file into the "load" directory of the assistant. It will prompt you to overwrite the file, tell it okay. (The same will also apply to the badges)
